Spring MVC Cookie

Simple framework for making cookies easier to use in Spring MVC, effectively 'strongly typing' them to be used in your controllers. Serves as an alternative to @CookieValue.

The reading and writing of your cookies is taken care of in the framework. You just express them as a parameter to a controller method.

1. Create Cookie (extends from BaseCookie)
2. Create Cookie Cutter (extend from CookieCutter)
3. Register CookieCutter with Spring context (will autowire into CookieHandlerInterceptor)
4. WebArgumentResolver for Cookie
5. Use in Controller classes!
